

This class Has Various Methods Such as to perform operations like converting Image to Binary Matrix or Binary Matrix To Image and others

Documnetation : -

Method 1  ----->

        int[][]  convertTo2DMatrix(String img) 
         
        This Function Will Convert the Image into 2D Matrix in the range of 0-255 
        Arguments : -String img ----> This is the image location

Method 2 ------>

         void BinaryToImage(String[][] result,String OutputLoc)

         Arguments param1 = String[][] result This is binary String Matrix in 0's and 1's forms
         param2 = String OutputLoc  This is the location to store the image to output directory
         This function Will Convert the given Matrix into a image from

Method 3 ------>
 
         String[][] ImageToBinary(String img)

         This Function is Used To convert the Image into Binary Represenatation in the specified 
         Length and breadth of Matrix
     
         Argument String img ----> This is the image location

Method 4 ------->

        int[][] convertTo2DAbsolute

         This method will take Image Location as a argument and Will convert it
         into 2D Matrix in abosolute Range of 32 bits
